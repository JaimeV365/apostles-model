## Core Philosophy & Principles

### The Product Vision

**Segmentor is a privacy-first, tool-first customer segmentation application based on the Apostles Model.**

**Core Values:**
- **Privacy First:** No data collection, no cookies, no cloud storage, 100% local processing
- **Tool-First:** The actual product is the star, not marketing fluff
- **Immediate Value:** Users should experience value quickly
- **Guided but Not Intrusive:** Help available, never forced
- **Returning User Friendly:** Power users get direct access without friction

**Selling Points:**
1. Turn customer feedback into actionable segments in 3 clicks
2. Your data never leaves your device
3. No tracking, no cookies, no cloud storage
4. Based on proven Apostles Model methodology
5. Visual, intuitive interface

---

## Website Structure Debate

### Initial Proposal (Questioned)

**Structure:**
1. Landing page = Marketing/Product description page
2. Tool = Secondary page accessed via CTA
3. FAQ = Tertiary
4. Contact = Quaternary

**Arguments FOR this structure:**
- ✅ Traditional marketing funnel approach
- ✅ Educates users before they try the tool
- ✅ Builds trust through persuasion content
- ✅ Works well for cold traffic (LinkedIn ads, etc.)
- ✅ Allows for sophisticated marketing content

**Arguments AGAINST this structure:**
- ❌ Returning users have to navigate to tool every time
- ❌ Adds friction for the #1 top task: "segment my customers"
- ❌ Tool is the real value, marketing page is just talk
- ❌ Not aligned with Product-Led Growth (PLG) model
- ❌ Forces users through persuasion when they want to try

**Gerry McGovern Top Tasks Concern:**
- If the #1 user task is "learn about segmentation" → Marketing first ✅
- If the #1 user task is "segment my customers" → Tool first ✅
- **For Segmentor, the top task IS using the tool** → Tool-first might be right

---

### Counter-Proposal (Preferred)

**Structure:**
1. Landing page = THE TOOL (with smart onboarding)
2. /about = Marketing/Product page (secondary, accessible via nav)
3. /faq = Self-service support
4. /contact = Direct support + lead generation

**Arguments FOR this structure:**
- ✅ Returning users land directly on the tool (zero friction)
- ✅ Aligns with Product-Led Growth (PLG) best practices
- ✅ "Show don't tell" - users experience value immediately
- ✅ Matches user expectation: segmentor.app = segmentation tool
- ✅ New users can be guided without leaving the tool

**Arguments AGAINST this structure:**
- ❌ Cold traffic might be confused without context
- ❌ Requires excellent onboarding to avoid high bounce rate
- ❌ Marketing content becomes secondary
- ❌ Harder to build trust with first-time visitors
- ❌ Need smart welcome experience to avoid confusion

**Real-World Examples Supporting Tool-First:**
- **Excalidraw.com** - Landing page is the drawing canvas
- **Remove.bg** - Landing page is the upload area  
- **Hemingway Editor** - Landing page is the editor itself
- **Figma/Miro** (recent versions) - Tool-first, marketing secondary

---

### The Hybrid Reality

**Both approaches can work - it depends on execution.**

**Key Success Factors for Tool-First:**
1. ✅ Smart onboarding for new users
2. ✅ Contextual help throughout the tool
3. ✅ Clear "What is this?" links to marketing page
4. ✅ Sample data option for immediate exploration
5. ✅ Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)

**Without these, tool-first WILL fail with high bounce rates.**

## Recommended Site Architecture

### Primary Structure (Tool-First with Marketing Support)

```
📱 segmentor.app
│
├─ 🏠 / (HOME = TOOL)
│   ├─ New users: Smart onboarding experience
│   ├─ Returning users: Direct tool access (after loading file)
│   └─ Navigation: Links to /about, /faq, /contact, help button
│
├─ 📄 /about (MARKETING/PRODUCT PAGE)
│   ├─ Hero: Value proposition + compelling visuals
│   ├─ Problem/Solution narrative
│   ├─ How it works (3 steps with visuals/video)
│   ├─ Benefits & features
│   ├─ Social proof (testimonials, stats)
│   ├─ Privacy promise (major differentiator)
│   ├─ Pricing (if applicable)
│   └─ CTA: "Try it free" → back to tool
│
├─ ❓ /faq
│   └─ Organized by user task frequency (McGovern style)
│
└─ 📧 /contact
    ├─ Support form (for existing users)
    └─ Business inquiry (lead generation)
```

### Page Purposes

| Page | Primary Audience | Goal | Success Metric |
|------|------------------|------|----------------|
| **/ (Tool)** | All users | Deliver value, enable segmentation | Tasks completed, files saved |
| **/about** | Cold prospects, skeptics | Persuade, educate, build trust | Click "Try it free" |
| **/faq** | Confused users | Self-service support | Problem solved without contact |
| **/contact** | Stuck users, potential customers | Support + lead generation | Issues resolved, demos booked |

---

## New vs Returning User Experience

### The Privacy Constraint

**Core Principle:** Cannot use cookies, localStorage, or any persistent tracking.

**Implication:** Cannot detect "returning" users automatically.

**Solution:** State-based detection, not user-based detection.

### User States

#### State 1: Empty State (No Data Loaded)
**Assumption:** New user OR returning user who hasn't loaded a file yet

**Experience:**
- Show welcome guidance
- Highlight CSV upload area
- Offer sample data option
- Provide "What is this?" links
- Make help immediately accessible

#### State 2: Data Loaded (Working State)
**Assumption:** User is actively working (new or returning)

**Experience:**
- Hide welcome guidance (no longer needed)
- Show full tool interface
- Provide contextual tooltips
- Keep help button accessible
- Enable save/export functions

#### State 3: Returning User (Loaded Previous File)
**Detection:** User has loaded a .seg project file

**Experience:**
- Skip all onboarding (they know the tool)
- Direct access to full functionality
- No welcome messages
- Just let them work

### State Transition Logic

```
User arrives → Check if data exists
│
├─ NO DATA → Show welcome guidance (State 1)
│   │
│   ├─ User uploads CSV → Hide guidance (State 2)
│   ├─ User loads .seg file → Skip guidance (State 3)
│   └─ User clicks sample data → Hide guidance (State 2)
│
└─ DATA EXISTS → Tool interface only (State 2/3)
```

**Privacy-Compliant Implementation:**
- Use in-memory state management
- Optional: Use `sessionStorage` (cleared when tab closes)
- Never use `localStorage`, cookies, or server tracking

---

## Help & Onboarding Strategies

### Option 1: Always-Visible, Non-Intrusive Guidance ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Concept:** Help banner is visible but doesn't block the tool.

**Implementation:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo] [About] [FAQ] [Help]                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐           │
│  │ 👋 New here?                     │ [X]       │
│  │ [Take Quick Tour] [See Example]  │           │
│  │ or just start by uploading data →│           │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘           │
│                                                 │
│  [CSV Upload Area - Tool Interface Visible]     │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ New users see help immediately
- ✅ Power users can dismiss (X button)
- ✅ Non-blocking (tool still usable)
- ✅ No delay, no false triggers

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Takes up screen space
- ⚠️ Some users might ignore it

**Best for:** General audiences, mix of new and returning users

---

### Option 2: Contextual Help (Progressive Disclosure)

**Concept:** Guidance appears where and when users need it.

**Implementation:**

**Empty state:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 1: Upload Customer Data            │
│  ─────────────────────────────────       │
│  📄 [Click to upload CSV]                │
│     or drag & drop here                  │
│                                          │
│  ℹ️ Need help? [CSV Format Guide]        │
│  📊 Or [Try sample data]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**After upload:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅ Data loaded: 150 customers           │
│                                          │
│  Step 2: Review Your Segments            │
│  [Visualization appears]                 │
│                                          │
│  💡 Tip: Click any point for details     │
│  ℹ️ [What do these zones mean?]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Help exactly when needed
- ✅ Doesn't interrupt confident users
- ✅ Guides step-by-step naturally
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (UX best practice)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Users might miss optional help links
- ⚠️ Requires careful UX design

**Best for:** Self-service tools, confident user base

---

### Option 3: Persistent "?" Help Button ⭐ PREFERRED BY USER

**Concept:** Help is always accessible, never intrusive.

**Implementation:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo] [About] [FAQ]           [? Help] │ ← Always visible
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          │
│  [Tool Interface - Clean, Unobstructed]  │
│                                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Click "?" opens side panel:**
```
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
                    │ Quick Start Guide    │
                    ├──────────────────────┤
                    │ 1. Upload CSV data   │
                    │ 2. View segments     │
                    │ 3. Analyze results   │
                    │                      │
                    │ [Full Tutorial →]    │
                    │ [FAQ →]              │
                    │ [Sample Data →]      │
                    └──────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero intrusion for power users
- ✅ Immediate access for confused users
- ✅ Clean interface (help when needed only)
- ✅ Simple implementation

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Some users might not discover it
- ⚠️ Requires user to be proactive

**Best for:** Users who prefer to explore first, ask later (modern UX trend)

---

### Option 4: Smart Empty State Detection ⭐ COMPLEMENTARY

**Concept:** If no data loaded, show guidance. If data exists, hide it.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function shouldShowGuidance() {
  return dataPoints.length === 0 && !hasLoadedFile;
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic based on context
- ✅ No cookies needed
- ✅ Smart logic, not guesswork
- ✅ Works for both new and returning users

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Still needs UI components (banner/tooltips/help button)

**Best for:** Backend logic to support Options 1-3

---

### ❌ Option 5: Delay-Based Triggering (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Concept:** Show guidance after X seconds of inactivity.

**Why it fails:**
1. **False Positive:** Power user pauses to think → Interrupted by modal
2. **False Negative:** Confused user clicks randomly → No help triggered
3. **Bad UX:** Help should be immediate, not delayed
4. **Unreliable:** Can't distinguish "thinking" from "confused"

**Verdict:** Do not implement this approach.

---

### Recommended Hybrid Strategy

**Combine Options 1, 3, and 4 for best results:**

1. **Always-visible help button** (Option 3) - for proactive users
2. **Dismissible welcome banner** when empty (Option 1) - for guidance
3. **State-based logic** (Option 4) - to show/hide automatically
4. **Contextual tooltips** throughout - for in-context help

**User Flow:**
```
New user arrives (no data)
    ↓
Welcome banner visible (dismissible)
    ↓
User can: [Take Tour] [Sample Data] [Upload CSV] [Dismiss]
    ↓
Once data loaded → Banner disappears automatically
    ↓
Help still accessible via [?] button
    ↓
Tooltips appear on hover throughout tool
```

## Privacy-First Approach

### The Core Promise

**"Your Data. Your Device. Your Privacy."**

- ✅ No cookies
- ✅ No cloud storage
- ✅ No tracking
- ✅ 100% local processing
- ✅ Data never leaves your computer

### What This Means Technically

#### ❌ Cannot Use:
- `localStorage` - persists across sessions
- Cookies - any kind, including session cookies
- IndexedDB - persistent browser storage
- Server-side tracking - no cloud data
- Analytics - Google Analytics, etc.

#### ✅ Can Use:
- `sessionStorage` - cleared when tab closes (acceptable for UX, not tracking)
- In-memory state - current session only
- File-based state - when user loads .seg project file
- URL parameters - for one-time marketing tracking (e.g., `?source=linkedin`)

### Session-Only State (Privacy-Compliant)

```javascript
// Acceptable: Cleared when tab closes
sessionStorage.setItem('tourDismissed', 'true');

// On page load
if (sessionStorage.getItem('tourDismissed') === 'true') {
  hideTourBanner();
}
```

**Why this is OK:**
- Cleared automatically when tab closes
- Doesn't persist across sessions
- Doesn't track users long-term
- Only for UX convenience (dismissing help banners)
- User-controlled (can clear manually)

### Marketing Copy for Privacy Promise

**Homepage/About Page:**
```
🔒 Your Data. Your Device. Your Privacy.

✅ No cookies
✅ No cloud storage  
✅ No tracking
✅ 100% local processing

Your customer data never leaves your computer.
```

**FAQ:**
```
Q: Is my data safe?
A: Your data never leaves your device. We don't store, 
   transmit, or track anything. Ever.

Q: Do you use cookies?
A: No. We don't use cookies or any persistent tracking.

Q: Where is my data stored?
A: Only on your device. You can save projects as files
   and load them later - but we never see them.

Q: Can I trust Segmentor with sensitive customer data?
A: Yes. Since all processing happens locally in your browser,
   we never have access to your data. It's technically 
   impossible for us to see it.
```

## Navigation & Information Architecture

### Header Navigation (All Pages)

**Primary Navigation:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ [Logo]  About  |  FAQ  |  Contact  |  [? Help]  [Try It Free →] ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**When in Tool (working state):**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ [Logo]  About  |  FAQ  |  Contact  |  [? Help]  [Save/Export] ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Information Hierarchy

**McGovern Top Tasks Priority:**

| Priority | Task | Implementation |
|----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Segment my customers | Tool (homepage) |
| 2 | Understand what this does | About page + [?] Help |
| 3 | Get help with tool | FAQ + Help panel |
| 4 | Save/export my work | Save button (in tool) |
| 5 | Is my data safe? | Privacy info (About + FAQ) |
| 6 | Contact for support | Contact page |

### FAQ Structure (Top Tasks Order)

**Organized by frequency of need, NOT alphabetically:**

**Section 1: Getting Started (Highest Priority)**
1. "How do I get started?"
2. "What data do I need to upload?"
3. "What format should my CSV be?"
4. "Can I try it without my own data?"

**Section 2: Using the Tool**
5. "What do the quadrants mean?"
6. "How do I interpret Apostles vs Terrorists?"
7. "How do I identify Near-Apostles?"
8. "Can I filter or exclude certain customers?"

**Section 3: Saving & Exporting**
9. "Can I save my work?"
10. "How do I load a previous project?"
11. "Can I export reports?"

**Section 4: Privacy & Security (Trust)**
12. "Is my data safe?"
13. "Do you use cookies?"
14. "Where is my data stored?"

**Section 5: Understanding the Model**
15. "What is the Apostles Model?"
16. "How is this different from NPS?"
17. "What makes someone an Apostle?"

---

## Marketing & Traffic Strategy

### Traffic Sources & Landing Page Strategy

#### LinkedIn Traffic (Primary Channel)

**Type A: Problem-Focused Posts**
*Example: "Struggling to identify your true brand advocates?"*

**Best landing page:** `/about` (marketing page)
- Use UTM: `segmentor.app/about?utm_source=linkedin&utm_content=problem-post`
- Why: They're problem-aware, need persuasion first
- CTA on marketing page: "Try it free" → Tool

**Type B: Product Demo Posts**
*Example: "Watch how Segmentor segments customers in 30 seconds"*

**Best landing page:** `/` (tool with context)
- Use UTM: `segmentor.app?utm_source=linkedin&utm_content=demo`
- Why: They've seen demo, want to try it
- Show shorter welcome message or sample data prompt

#### SEO Traffic

**Keyword:** "customer segmentation tool", "apostles model", "NPS alternative"

**Best landing page:** `/about` (marketing page)
- Why: Educational intent, need context first
- Rich content for SEO ranking
- Clear path to tool via CTAs

#### Direct Traffic

**Bookmark/Word of Mouth:** `segmentor.app`

**Best landing page:** `/` (tool)
- Why: They know what it is, want to use it
- Returning users should land on tool directly

### UTM Parameter Strategy

**Track campaign effectiveness without cookies:**

```javascript
// Read UTM on page load (doesn't persist)
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const source = urlParams.get('utm_source');
const content = urlParams.get('utm_content');

// Customize welcome experience (this session only)
if (source === 'linkedin' && content === 'demo') {
  showQuickStartGuide(); // Shorter onboarding
} else if (source === 'linkedin' && content === 'problem-post') {
  showFullTour(); // More education needed
}

// Don't store this data - just use it for immediate UX
```

**Privacy compliance:** UTM parameters are read once, used for UX customization, never stored.

---

5. In-app tutorial mode (optional walkthrough)
6. Help panel with searchable content

**Success Criteria:**
- Reduced support requests
- Higher conversion from /about to tool
- Positive user feedback on onboarding

---

## Open Questions & Future Decisions

### Questions Still To Resolve

1. **Premium Features:**
   - Do we need a premium tier?
   - If yes, how to handle access control without cookies?
   - Secret codes vs credentials?

2. **Welcome Banner Persistence:**
   - Should dismissed banner stay gone across sessions? (Needs sessionStorage)
   - Or reappear every new session? (More privacy-pure, possibly annoying)

3. **Marketing Page Depth:**
   - How sophisticated should /about be?
   - Videos? Animations? Interactive demos?
   - What's the right level of investment?

4. **Sample Data:**
   - What customer segment data to include?
   - How many data points?
   - Should it be randomized or fixed?

5. **Mobile Experience:**
   - Is the tool mobile-friendly?
   - Should mobile users be directed to /about first?
   - Touch-friendly help buttons?

6. **Localization:**
   - Multi-language support needed?
   - Which markets to target?

---

### Decisions Made (For Reference)

✅ **Tool-first structure** - Landing page = Tool (with smart onboarding)  
✅ **Privacy-first approach** - No cookies, no cloud, no tracking  
✅ **Help button in header** - Always accessible, never intrusive  
✅ **State-based guidance** - Show help when empty, hide when working  
✅ **sessionStorage is acceptable** - For UX only, cleared on tab close  
✅ **Marketing page is secondary** - /about exists but tool is primary  
✅ **FAQ organized by top tasks** - Not alphabetical, by user need frequency
