# Data Filtering Feature for Apostles Model

## Implementation Summary
I've created a set of components that add powerful filtering capabilities to the Apostles Model visualization. These filters allow users to:

1. **Filter by date ranges** with convenient presets and custom date selection
2. **Filter by any attribute** in the data, automatically detecting available fields
3. **Combine multiple filters** for precise data segmentation

## Technical Details
The implementation consists of these new components:

- **FilterPanel**: The main panel containing all filtering options
- **FilterToggle**: Button to show/hide the filter panel
- **FilteredChart**: A wrapper around the existing QuadrantChart that adds filtering

The filter system:
- Automatically detects date fields and other attributes in the data
- Dynamically generates filter options based on the available data
- Maintains state for active filters and filtered data
- Provides visual feedback about active filters and filtered data counts

## UX Considerations
The design follows UX best practices:
- **Unobtrusive**: The filter panel slides in from the right, not disrupting the main visualization
- **Intuitive**: Clear organization of filters with expandable sections
- **Responsive**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Informative**: Shows counts of filtered vs. total data points
- **Flexible**: Date presets for common scenarios plus custom date range option

## User Guide

### Using the Filter Panel
1. Click the filter icon (funnel shape) in the top-right corner of the visualization
2. The filter panel slides in from the right
3. Use date range filters and attribute filters as needed
4. Filter changes apply automatically
5. Click outside the panel or the X button to close it

### Date Filtering
- Choose from preset options like "Today", "Last 7 Days", "This Month", etc.
- For custom date ranges, click "Custom Range" and select start/end dates
- Active date range is displayed with a green background

### Attribute Filtering
- Click on an attribute name to expand its values
- Check the values you want to include
- Each value shows the count of data points in parentheses
- Click "Clear" to reset filters for a specific attribute

### Resetting Filters
- Click "Reset All" at the bottom of the panel to clear all filters
- Or use individual "Clear" buttons next to each filter section

## Benefits
This filtering system enhances the Apostles Model by:
- **Enabling data exploration** from different angles and time periods
- **Supporting deeper analysis** by isolating specific segments
- **Improving insights** through focused visualization of related data points
- **Enhancing presentations** by highlighting relevant segments during discussions

The implementation is designed to scale with the application, handling any additional data fields that might be added in the future.
