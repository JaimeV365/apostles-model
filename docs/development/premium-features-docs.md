}

const PREVIEW_CONFIGS: Record<string, PreviewConfig> = {
  frequency: {
    duration: 2000,
    sampleSize: Infinity,
    showUpgrade: true
  },
  filtering: {
    duration: null,    // Until filter change

  },
  clustering: {
    duration: 2000,
    sampleSize: 3,
    showUpgrade: true
  }
};
```

### Feature Management

const handlePremiumFeature = (feature: string) => {
  const config = PREVIEW_CONFIGS[feature];
  
  // Enable preview
  enableFeature(feature);
  
  // Handle preview timeout
  if (config.duration) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      disableFeature(feature);
