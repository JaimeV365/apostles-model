# Historical Analysis Feature Specification

## Overview
The Historical Analysis feature enhances the Apostles Model by introducing temporal dimension analysis, enabling tracking of customer satisfaction and loyalty changes over time, along with behavioral validation capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. Temporal Data Tracking
- Track satisfaction and loyalty scores over time
- Associate multiple data points with single customer via email
- Handle anonymous entries appropriately
- Support variable time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly)

### 2. Behavioral Validation
- Track stated intentions vs actual behavior
- Compare NPS/loyalty scores against actual recommendations/purchases
- Analyze discrepancies between intended and actual behavior

### 3. Movement Analysis
- Track customer movement between quadrants
- Analyze individual vs population changes
- Support cohort analysis
  - Retained customers analysis
  - New customer analysis
  - Lost customer analysis

### 4. Significance Testing
- Identify meaningful changes vs normal variations
- Provide confidence indicators for changes
- Support statistical analysis of movements

## User Experience

   - Email field parsing
   - Behavioral data columns

2. Manual Entry Additions
   - Date field (required for historical tracking)
   - Email field (optional but recommended)
   - Actual behavior fields (optional)

### Visualization
1. Time-Based Filters
   - Period selection
   - Date range filters
   - Cohort selection

2. Historical Views
   - Movement flow diagrams
   - Trend charts
   - Comparison views

### Reporting
1. Historical Report (New)
   - Individual customer timelines
   - Population trend analysis
   - Cohort comparisons
   - Behavioral validation analysis

2. Enhanced Data Report
   - Time period snapshots
   - Filter controls for date ranges
   - Aggregate statistics

3. Enhanced Action Report
   - Time-based recommendations
   - Trend-based insights
   - Movement-specific actions

## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure Updates
```typescript
interface DataPoint {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;           // New field
  timestamp: Date;          // New field
  satisfaction: number;
  loyalty: number;
  group: string;
  excluded?: boolean;
  actualBehavior?: {        // New field
    didRecommend?: boolean;
    didRepurchase?: boolean;
    date?: Date;
  }
}

interface HistoricalAnalysis {
  customerChanges: {
    email: string;
    timeline: DataPoint[];
    movements: QuadrantMovement[];
    significance: SignificanceLevel;
  }[];
  populationChanges: {
    period: DateRange;
    retained: CohortAnalysis;
    new: CohortAnalysis;
    lost: CohortAnalysis;
  }[];
}
```
